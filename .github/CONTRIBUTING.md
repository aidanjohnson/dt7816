## Contribution Workflow

The workflow are the written procedures for issues, and pull requests and merging related to this project. Putting it all in writing limits conflict. If you are a contributor to this project, you are required to follow these guidelines and procedure. Please refer to the 
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aidanjohnson/dt7816/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as well as the [Pull Request](https://github.com/aidanjohnson/dt7816/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) and [Issue](https://github.com/aidanjohnson/dt7816/blob/master/.github/issue_template.md) templates. Many thanks to [@funnyabc](https://github.com/funnyabc) for drafting this workflow and selecting the templates (released to the Public Domain by [Steve Mao](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates)).

### Summary

* Everyone will be on the master branch, but every time there is a new feature being added, it needs to be in a separate branch.

* Each branch must be synched up with the master repository, so as to not cause many conflicts when developing and submitting pull requests. When a feature is ready to be added, the user must submit a pull request (using the template) with the master branch and [@aidanjohnson](https://github.com/aidanjohnson) needs to verify the feature will be compatible.

* Only one person, the verifier [@aidanjohnson](https://github.com/aidanjohnson), reviews pull requests and issues reports for features, bug fixes, and improvements, and only merges them to the master branch when the changes are confirmed as functional and compatible. Only after testing, the changes are integrated.

### Workflow Steps

The basic workflow are be defined as the following steps:

1. Create a new branch. (Ensure to keep this branch updated with master during the entire development process.)

2. Develop the feature.

3. Test the feature until all cases covered and can confirm that it does not adversely affect any other project featured.

4. Submit an issue stating the proposed change. Then submit pull request with that feature. (If any changes need to be made according to the verifier, make them and resubmit). Be sure to fill out the [pull request](https://github.com/aidanjohnson/dt7816/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) and [issue](https://github.com/aidanjohnson/dt7816/blob/master/.github/issue_template.md) templates when doing so.

### Style

Refer to this [guide](http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~piater/Cours/Coding-Style/index.html) for recommended style. The general principle is to remember other people will be reading your code so keep it readable. In other words, try to follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
